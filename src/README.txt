Drip -- Memory Leak Detector for Internet Explorer

I'll call this version, umm...., 0.2 (for wont of a better name).  It basically
works at this point, allowing you to detect leaked DOM elements in Internet
Explorer.  For more detailed information, go to jgwebber.blogspot.com, where
you'll find much more detailed information and discussion.

The included project was built under MSVC 2003, but it should be pretty easy to
build under just about any non-ancient version.  If you have trouble with it,
feel free to contact me.

Enjoy!
