<!-- The explanation of leaks caused bt the Cycle via a closure'

This small page causes 3 DOM leaks. What is the leak scenario?

The function addleak(a,b) has 2 formal parameters 'a' and 'b' and a local variable
'localDevin'. The actual function call will create a stackframe for holding 3 variables.
In our example the stack-frame will look like this:

1) a = reference to 'matthiasDiv'
2) b = reference to 'johanDiv' 
3) localDevin = reference to 'devinDiv' 

Then the function addleak will create a new function instance which will be returned.
However the function is EMPTY doing nothing with the localfunction scope of its parent
'addleak'. But it is allowed to use anything of its parents scope and since the parents
scope is a temporary scope (a function call) it will just copy the stackframe of its
parent whithout analyzing what is actual necessary inside the new created function.
So conclusion is the function (even the empty function) returned by addleak(a,b) will hold 3
references in our example. 

Then as final step the cycle is created by assigning the returned function pointer
(holding the 3 references) to a property of 'matthiasDiv'. And because of the fact
that one of the 3 references points to 'matthiasDiv' we have a cycle.

And we obviously know that the IE garbage collector doesn't recognize the cycles.
